# Hello, World!
Welcome to the home of EOSTRE. EOSTRE is part experimental laboratory in the cloud, and part experiment itself - to see if experimental laboratories can even exist in the cloud.

The idea behind EOSTRE is to try and run a laboratory the following way:

<ul>
<li>Business administration and registration are provided by <a href="https://www.xolo.io/"><span style="color: #082471;">Xolo</span></a>, with banking handled by <a href="https://transferwise.com/"><span style="color: #00c6ff;">TransferWise</span></a>,</li>
<li>Business Insurance will be covered through <a href="https://withlayr.com/"><span style="color: #00ff8c;">Layr</span></a>, and Health Insurance will be covered through <a href="https://www.worldnomads.ca/"><span style="color: #ff9c00;">World Nomads</span></a>,</li>
<li>Genetic code optimization is completed with <a href="https://www.atum.bio/resources/tools/gene-designer"><span style="color: #d0343b;">Gene Designer</span></a>, genetic networks design with <a href="https://github.com/CIDARLAB/eugene-v2.0"><span style="color: #ef7226;">Eu</span><span style="color: #676767;">gene</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/CIDARLAB/clotho3"><span style="color: #676767;">Clotho</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/ibiosim"><span style="color: #bf1e2e;">iBioSim</span></a>,</li>
<li>Synthesis is ordered and completed through <a href="https://www.twistbioscience.com/"><span style="color: #51bb79;">Twist Bioscience</span></a>,</li>
<li>Characterization, experimentation, and method development is performed through various facilities thanks to <a href="https://www.scientist.com/"><span style="color: #6ec7b9;">scientist.com</span></a>,</li>
<li>Publications will be posted to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/"><span style="color: #676767;">bio</span><span style="color: #bd2736;">R</span><span style="color: #676767;">xiv</span></a> and all supplementary dashboards will be made in <a href="https://jupyter.org/"><span style="color: #f37726;">Jupyter</span></a> notebooks,</li>
<li>Collaborations and ordering are mediated using the <a href="https://biobricks.org/openmta/"><span style="color: #558818;">Open</span><span style="color: #1b7373;">MTA</span></a>.</li>
</ul>

The goal of this blog is two-fold: First, I want to experiment with the amount of content that can be open-sourced through a laboratory. Everything from the genetic network design principles, to any software or code developed, to all negative results, and even grant applications as soon as they're submitted. I intend to apply to <a href="https://mozilla.fluxx.io/apply/awards"><span style="background-color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">moz://a</span></span></a> and <a href="https://helloscience.io/"><span style="color: #5171ff;">HelloScience</span></a>, and maybe even produce a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"><span style="background-color: #ee1c1b;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">YouTube</span></span></a> series or two for additional funding. Second, an online platform is needed to host the results dashboards openly to allow people to review the data as replicates trickle in live.

I don't know where this leads, but I hope somewhere good, and if you'd like to help, just <a href="mailto:john@eost.re">reach out</a>!
